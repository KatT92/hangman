# Hangman

    > Making a hangman game using python. 
    
The game asks the user to input a letter using the command line. The input is then checked to see whether it passes certain conditions using the ask_letter function. If it passes the checks, it calls the check_letter function to check whether the letter is in the word. It continues doing this until the word has been guessed or number of lives reaches 0.
